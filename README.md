IDEA : Opitimum Office/Shift-Traffic Timings Predictor:

There is a problem that every metropolitan city faces, traffic jams during rush hours 8am-11am in morning and 5pm onwards in evening. A lot of time of brilliant mind is wasted which they could have used productively. We intend to analyse the data from traffic sensors and give companies schedules which they can opt as work timings to minimise this waste of time. A common platform on which all companies can register to get an optimised office timing schedule for their employees.
