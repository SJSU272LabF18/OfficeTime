IDEA 1:
Presentations are an important part of all types of knowledge sharing events, whether it is a classroom, a research conference or a business presentation. In these presentations or lectures catering large number of attendees, the big dilemma is to know whether the person sitting in the last row is able to view the text on the screen clearly. Normally the host can ask from the viewers itself, but sometimes viewers don’t feel comfortable or are too shy or too far to communicate the real thing and just nod even if the text is not visible to them, thus making the feedback unreliable. This ultimately leads to disinterested last bench viewers and thus demeans the overall goal of covering everyone in the crowd. Since a lot of money is invested in these presentations, even if we have one such viewer, it is loss of valuable resources and time.
We intend to design a solution for this problem which can compute the font size depending upon the size of the room. It should display a sample letter on the screen so that host can set similar font size of the presentation text.

IDEA 2:
A lot of stress is given on mitigating plagiarism from research and other patent documents. Though it does seems a good approach for simplifying governance but it takes a lot of time for genuine inventors to prepare a completely novel language statements for content that have already been said before by other authors. It is a wastage of precious time that could have been utilised in proper research. What I feel is Idea should be unique not the implementation of it. 
We intend to design a tool which will have database of all the ideas and then it will compare any new idea with its database to check if the idea exists or not. Thus an innovator has to be concerned only about inventing and not representing.

IDEA 3:
There is a problem that every metropolitan city faces, traffic jams during rush hours 8am-11am in morning and 5pm onwards in evening. A lot of time of brilliant mind is wasted which they could have used productively. We intend to analyse the data from traffic sensors and give companies schedules which they can opt as work timings to minimise this waste of time. A common platform on which all companies can register to get an optimised office timing schedule for their employees.

IDEA 4:
Goal: Detecting spam emails
Abstract:
Majority of email service providers are using some algorithms for detecting spam emails. Still, we receive some of the spam emails in our inbox (for example, phishing mails) and some non-spam emails are incorrectly redirected to the spam folder. The goal here is to design a spam detection algorithm which will remove these loopholes.

IDEA 5:
Goal: Converting MySQL query to MongoDB query
Abstract:
We have checked various online tools which convert a MySQL query to a MongoDB query. However, most of these programs are limited to only MySQL select statements. The goal here is to design a website which will include comprehensive translation from MySQL to MongoDB.

IDEA 6:

We are continuously in the need of a household helper who could design our everyday menu for us after acquiring knowledge gained over a period of time. Something which should keep our nutritional needs in mind and tell us what needs to be cooked today and also remind us to keep a check on our groceries and if we need to buy them whenever needed. The problem lies in the fact that we need to think daily what to make and the process tends to get monotonous after a while and we never cook more than 2 or 3 things. This is what needs to be solved!

IDEA 7:

At work each one has an annual work plan. People are expected to work to achieve each of these objectives.And it is very easy to lose track of your tasks or your objectives.So there should be something which should help you figure out your daily plan, keeping in mind your work load and be able to tweak the tasks accordingly. For example, if you have overworked in the first half it should suggest you to do something lighter for the rest of the day. We could maybe figure out when a person is over stressed and over worked and tell them to take a break. This seems to be very essential when it comes to productivity which is directly proportional to a person’s state of mind.
